    <p>Charlie Chaplin Impersonates a Poet
        BY CORNELIUS EADY
        The stage is set for imminent disaster.
        Here is the little tramp, standing
        On a stack of books in order
        To reach the microphone, the
        Poet he’s impersonating somehow
        Trussed and mumbling in a
        Tweed bundle at his feet.
        
        He opens his mouth: Tra-la!
        Out comes doves, incandescent bulbs,
        Plastic roses. Well, that’s that,
        Squirms the young professor who’s
        Coordinated this,
        No more visiting poets!
        
        His department head groans
        For the trap door. As it
        Swings away
        
        The tramp keeps on as if
        Nothing has occurred,
        A free arm mimicking
        A wing.

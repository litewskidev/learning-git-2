            <p>
                The stage is set for imminent disaster.
                Here is the little tramp, standing
                On a stack of books in order
                To reach the microphone, the
                Poet he’s impersonating somehow
                Trussed and mumbling in a
                Tweed bundle at his feet.
                
                He opens his mouth: Tra-la!
                Out comes doves, incandescent bulbs,
                Plastic roses. Well, that’s that,
                Squirms the young professor who’s
                Coordinated this,
                No more visiting poets!
                
                His department head groans
                For the trap door. As it
                Swings away
                
                The tramp keeps on as if
                Nothing has occurred,
                A free arm mimicking
                A wing.
